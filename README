Feature overview matrix for Perl 6 compilers

This is an attempt to collect an overview of implemented features in
contemporary Perl 6 compilers.

The idea is to have a concise and easy-to-write source file which contains the
data, and a script that converts this information into a format that is easy
to read, like a colored HTML table or so.
